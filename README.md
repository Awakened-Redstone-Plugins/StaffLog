# StaffLog
StaffLog is  plugin that allows server owners to administrate their staff with the command `/staff-log log` that allow them to look all the command their staff ran and tried to run.
It also allows staff to play normally with the command `/staff-mode` that switches between staff and non-staff.

# Important
To allow staff to switch between staff and a rank you need to set their LuckPerms group to the rank and than add them to the plugin.
